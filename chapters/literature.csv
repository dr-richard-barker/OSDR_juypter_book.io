33242417,Comprehensive Multi-omics Analysis Reveals Mitochondrial Stress as a Central Biological Hub for Spaceflight Impact.,"Spaceflight is known to impose changes on human physiology with unknown molecular etiologies. To reveal these causes, we used a multi-omics, systems biology analytical approach using biomedical profiles from fifty-nine astronauts and data from NASA's GeneLab derived from hundreds of samples flown in space to determine transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenetic responses to spaceflight. Overall pathway analyses on the multi-omics datasets showed significant enrichment for mitochondrial processes, as well as innate immunity, chronic inflammation, cell cycle, circadian rhythm, and olfactory functions. Importantly, NASA's Twin Study provided a platform to confirm several of our principal findings. Evidence of altered mitochondrial function and DNA damage was also found in the urine and blood metabolic data compiled from the astronaut cohort and NASA Twin Study data, indicating mitochondrial stress as a consistent phenotype of spaceflight.",da Silveira WA; Fazelinia H; Rosenthal SB; Laiakis EC; Kim MS; Meydan C; Kidane Y; Rathi KS; Smith SM; Stear B; Ying Y; Zhang Y; Foox J; Zanello S; Crucian B; Wang D; Nugent A; Costa HA; Zwart SR; Schrepfer S; Elworth RAL; Sapoval N; Treangen T; MacKay M; Gokhale NS; Horner SM; Singh LN; Wallace DC; Willey JS; Schisler JC; Meller R; McDonald JT; Fisch KM; Hardiman G; Taylor D; Mason CE; Costes SV; Beheshti A,GeneLab; NASA; NASA Twin Study; Rodent Research Missions; lipids; microgravity; mitochondria; space radiation; spaceflight; transcriptomic,2020,Cell,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",R01 CA249054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R01 MH117406/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States; NNX14AH50G/NASA/NASA/United States; R01 AG066710/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States; UL1 TR001442/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States; U54 MD010706/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States; NNX17AB26G/NASA/NASA/United States; P30 CA051008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; U01 DA045300/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States
33242416,Fundamental Biological Features of Spaceflight: Advancing the Field to Enable Deep-Space Exploration.,"Research on astronaut health and model organisms have revealed six features of spaceflight biology that guide our current understanding of fundamental molecular changes that occur during space travel. The features include oxidative stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysregulation, epigenetic changes (including gene regulation), telomere length alterations, and microbiome shifts. Here we review the known hazards of human spaceflight, how spaceflight affects living systems through these six fundamental features, and the associated health risks of space exploration.

36835504,Space Omics and Tissue Response in Astronaut Skeletal Muscle after Short and Long Duration Missions.,"The molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle adaptation to spaceflight are as yet not fully investigated and well understood. The MUSCLE BIOPSY study analyzed pre and postflight deep calf muscle biopsies (m. soleus) obtained from five male International Space Station (ISS) astronauts. Moderate rates of myofiber atrophy were found in long-duration mission (LDM) astronauts (~180 days in space) performing routine inflight exercise as countermeasure (CM) compared to a short-duration mission (SDM) astronaut (11 days in space, little or no inflight CM) for reference control. Conventional H&E scout histology showed enlarged intramuscular connective tissue gaps between myofiber groups in LDM post vs. preflight. Immunoexpression signals of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, collagen 4 and 6, COL4 and 6, and perlecan were reduced while matrix-metalloproteinase, MMP2, biomarker remained unchanged in LDM post vs. preflight suggesting connective tissue remodeling. Large scale proteomics (space omics) identified two canonical protein pathways associated to muscle weakness (necroptosis, GP6 signaling/COL6) in SDM and four key pathways (Fatty acid β-oxidation, integrin-linked kinase ILK, Rho A GTPase RHO, dilated cardiomyopathy signaling) explicitly in LDM. The levels of structural ECM organization proteins COL6A1/A3, fibrillin 1, FBN1, and lumican, LUM, increased in postflight SDM vs. LDM. Proteins from tricarboxylic acid, TCA cycle, mitochondrial respiratory chain, and lipid metabolism mostly recovered in LDM vs. SDM. High levels of calcium signaling proteins, ryanodine receptor 1, RyR1, calsequestrin 1/2, CASQ1/2, annexin A2, ANXA2, and sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA1) pump, ATP2A, were signatures of SDM, and decreased levels of oxidative stress peroxiredoxin 1, PRDX1, thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase, PRDX3, or superoxide dismutase [Mn] 2, SOD2, signatures of LDM postflight. Results help to better understand the spatiotemporal molecular adaptation of skeletal muscle and provide a large scale database of skeletal muscle from human spaceflight for the better design of effective CM protocols in future human deep space exploration.",Blottner D; Moriggi M; Trautmann G; Hastermann M; Capitanio D; Torretta E; Block K; Rittweger J; Limper U; Gelfi C; Salanova M,protein signaling pathways; proteomics; skeletal muscle; spaceflight; structural proteins,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,Journal Article,50WB0821-1121/Deutsches Zentrum für Luft und Raumfahrt e.V.

Recent molecular biology experiments include ""omic"" analysis, which provides a holistic and systems level understanding of the mechanisms underlying phenotypic adaptation. Despite vast interest in, and the immense quantity of biological information gained from space omics research, the knowledge of ESA-related space omics works as a collective remains poorly defined due to the recent exponential application of omics approaches in space and the limited search capabilities of pre-existing records. Thus, a review of such contributions is necessary to clarify and promote the development of space omics among ESA and ESA state members. To address this gap, in this review, we i) identified and summarized omics works led by European researchers, ii) geographically described these omics works, and iii) highlighted potential caveats in complex funding scenarios among ESA member states.",Deane CS; da Silveira WA; Herranz R,Astrobiology; Omics; Space medicine; Space sciences,2022,iScience,Journal Article; Review,MR/T026014/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom
36126744,Multi-system responses to altered gravity and spaceflight: Insights from Drosophila melanogaster.,"NASA is planning to resume human-crewed lunar missions and lay the foundation for human exploration to Mars. However, our knowledge of the overall effects of long-duration spaceflight on human physiology is limited. During spaceflight, astronauts are exposed to multiple risk factors, including gravitational changes, ionizing radiation, physiological stress, and altered circadian lighting. These factors contribute to pathophysiological responses that target different organ systems in the body. This review discusses the advancements in gravitational biology using Drosophila melanogaster, one of the first organisms to be launched into space. As a well-established spaceflight model organism, fruit flies have yielded significant information, including neurobehavioral, aging, immune, cardiovascular, developmental, and multi-omics changes across tissues and developmental stages, as detailed in this review.",Iyer J; Mhatre SD; Gilbert R; Bhattacharya S,Drosophila melanogaster; Gravity; Model organism; Spaceflight,2022,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Review",
36277820,Routine omics collection is a golden opportunity for European human research in space and analog environments.,"Widespread generation and analysis of omics data have revolutionized molecular medicine on Earth, yet its power to yield new mechanistic insights and improve occupational health during spaceflight is still to be fully realized in humans. Nevertheless, rapid technological advancements and ever-regular spaceflight programs mean that longitudinal, standardized, and cost-effective collection of human space omics data are firmly within reach. Here, we consider the practicality and scientific return of different sampling methods and omic types in the context of human spaceflight. We also appraise ethical and legal considerations pertinent to omics data derived from European astronauts and spaceflight participants (SFPs). Ultimately, we propose that a routine omics collection program in spaceflight and analog environments presents a golden opportunity. Unlocking this bright future of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analyses and personalized medicine approaches will require further investigation into best practices, including policy design and standardization of omics data, metadata, and sampling methods.",Cope H; Willis CRG; MacKay MJ; Rutter LA; Toh LS; Williams PM; Herranz R; Borg J; Bezdan D; Giacomello S; Muratani M; Mason CE; Etheridge T; Szewczyk NJ,European Space Agency; GDPR; International Space Station; artificial intelligence; astronaut ethics; biobank; commercial spaceflight; longitudinal monitoring; multiomics; personalized medicine,2022,"Patterns (New York, N.Y.)",Journal Article; Review,
38191486,Altered quorum sensing and physiology of Staphylococcus aureus during spaceflight detected by multi-omics data analysis.,"Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the nares of approximately 30% of humans, a risk factor for opportunistic infections. To gain insight into S. aureus virulence potential in the spaceflight environment, we analyzed RNA-Seq, cellular proteomics, and metabolomics data from the ""Biological Research in Canisters-23"" (BRIC-23) GeneLab spaceflight experiment, a mission designed to measure the response of S. aureus to growth in low earth orbit on the international space station. This experiment used Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) to grow asynchronous ground control and spaceflight cultures of S. aureus for 48 h. RNAIII, the effector of the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, was the most highly upregulated gene transcript in spaceflight relative to ground controls. The agr operon gene transcripts were also highly upregulated during spaceflight, followed by genes encoding phenol-soluble modulins and secreted proteases, which are positively regulated by Agr. Upregulated spaceflight genes/proteins also had functions related to urease activity, type VII-like Ess secretion, and copper transport. We also performed secretome analysis of BRIC-23 culture supernatants, which revealed that spaceflight samples had increased abundance of secreted virulence factors, including Agr-regulated proteases (SspA, SspB), staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), and EsxA (secreted by the Ess system). These data also indicated that S. aureus metabolism is altered in spaceflight conditions relative to the ground controls. Collectively, these data suggest that S. aureus experiences increased quorum sensing and altered expression of virulence factors in response to the spaceflight environment that may impact its pathogenic potential.",Hauserman MR; Ferraro MJ; Carroll RK; Rice KC,,2024,NPJ microgravity,Journal Article,"80NSSC19K0139/NASA | Kennedy Space Center (KSC, Inc.)/; 80NSSC21K0601/NASA | Kennedy Space Center (KSC, Inc.)/"
37636054,Enhancing European capabilities for application of multi-omics studies in biology and biomedicine space research.,"Following on from the NASA twins' study, there has been a tremendous interest in the use of omics techniques in spaceflight. Individual space agencies, NASA's GeneLab, JAXA's ibSLS, and the ESA-funded Space Omics Topical Team and the International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP) groups have established several initiatives to support this growth. Here, we present recommendations from the Space Omics Topical Team to promote standard application of space omics in Europe. We focus on four main themes: i) continued participation in and coordination with international omics endeavors, ii) strengthening of the European space omics infrastructure including workforce and facilities, iii) capitalizing on the emerging opportunities in the commercial space sector, and iv) capitalizing on the emerging opportunities in human subjects research.",Manzano A; Weging S; Bezdan D; Borg J; Cahill T; Carnero-Diaz E; Cope H; Deane CS; Etheridge T; Giacomello S; Hardiman G; Leys N; Madrigal P; Mastroleo F; Medina FJ; Mieczkowski J; Fernandez-Rojo MA; Siew K; Szewczyk NJ; Walsh SB; da Silveira WA; Herranz R,Genomics; Proteomics; Space medicine; Space sciences,2023,iScience,Journal Article; Review,MR/T026014/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom

In this review, we highlight the application of omics, including transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics, multi-omics, and integrated omics in the study of spaceflown C. elegans, and discuss the impact, use, and future direction of this branch of research. We highlight the variety of molecular alterations that occur in response to spaceflight, most notably changes in metabolic and neuromuscular gene regulation. These transcriptional features are reproducible and evident across many spaceflown species (e.g., mice and astronauts), supporting the use of C. elegans as a model organism to study spaceflight physiology with translational capital. Integrating tissue-specific, spatial, and multi-omics approaches, which quantitatively link molecular responses to phenotypic adaptations, will facilitate the identification of candidate regulatory molecules for therapeutic intervention and thus represents the next frontiers in C. elegans space omics research.",Scott A; Willis CRG; Muratani M; Higashitani A; Etheridge T; Szewczyk NJ; Deane CS,Model organism; Omics; Space sciences,2023,iScience,Journal Article; Review,
30362880,"Is Space the New Frontier for Omics? Mars-Omics, Planetary Science, and the Next-Generation Technology Futurists.","Omics technologies are key to research and innovation in human health, food and nutrition, drugs, agriculture, and ecology research. Yet, the actual scope of applications is much broader. One emerging possibility is planetary science driven in part by current debates on and possibilities for travel to Mars. In July 2018, radar evidence has suggested the presence of subglacial liquid water in a 20-km-wide zone, likely a saltwater lake, in the Planum Australe region in the south pole of Mars. If confirmed, this will be a promising place to search for microbial life on the red planet. Meanwhile, existential threats to life on earth such as climate change are bolstering the current interests by spacefaring nations for manned long-term space travel to other planets. A new global space industry is also on the rise; Mars-related technology innovation could potentially allow for rapid Earth-to-Earth transport as well, for example, in times of humanitarian and ecological crisis. Against this overarching context, we coin and define here the new concept of ""Mars-omics"": the systems level study of how travel to and being on Mars affect human health, and how human presence on Mars impacts the life forms that might already be there, through changes such as space agriculture and other planetary transformations in Mars. Additionally, Mars-omics calls for new ways of thinking about scientific uncertainty and technology futures in such highly novel contexts. For example, how shall we frame scientific uncertainty when extrapolation of scientific unknowns across the planets is vastly difficult, nonlinear, and complex? Is uncertainty an accident or integral part of emerging technologies? These questions are important for achieving new relevance for and future progress in omics system science applications in planetary science and space explorations. In summary, this article suggests that omics has relevance in contexts beyond those on planet Earth. Moreover, past omics applications such as precision medicine may need to be reconceptualized in future novel settings, such as long-term space travel. We conclude the article with the key tenets of next-generation futurists in a context of Mars-omics.

37524737,Paving the way to better understand the effects of prolonged spaceflight on operational performance and its neural bases.,"Space exploration objectives will soon move from low Earth orbit to distant destinations like Moon and Mars. The present work provides an up-to-date roadmap that identifies critical research gaps related to human behavior and performance in altered gravity and space. The roadmap summarizes (1) key neurobehavioral challenges associated with spaceflight, (2) the need to consider sex as a biological variable, (3) the use of integrative omics technologies to elucidate mechanisms underlying changes in the brain and behavior, and (4) the importance of understanding the neural representation of gravity throughout the brain and its multisensory processing. We then highlight the need for a variety of target-specific countermeasures, and a personalized administration schedule as two critical strategies for mitigating potentially adverse effects of spaceflight on the central nervous system and performance. We conclude with a summary of key priorities for the roadmaps of current and future space programs and stress the importance of new collaborative strategies across agencies and researchers for fostering an integrative cross- and transdisciplinary approach from cells, molecules to neural circuits and cognitive performance. Finally, we highlight that space research in neurocognitive science goes beyond monitoring and mitigating risks in astronauts but could also have significant benefits for the population on Earth.",Stahn AC; Bucher D; Zu Eulenburg P; Denise P; Smith N; Pagnini F; White O,,2023,NPJ microgravity,Journal Article; Review,
33347069,"Twins, Telomeres, and Aging-in Space!","BACKGROUND: The landmark National Aeronautics and Space Administration Twins Study represented an integrated effort to launch human space life science research into the modern age of molecular- and ""omics""-based studies. As part of the first One-Year Mission aboard the International Space Station, identical twin astronauts Scott and Mark Kelly were the subjects of this ""out of this world"" research opportunity. Telomeres, the natural ends of chromosomes that shorten with cell division and a host of lifestyle factors and stresses, are key molecular determinants of aging and aging trajectories. METHODS: We proposed that telomere length dynamics (changes over time) represent a particularly relevant and integrative biomarker for astronauts, as they reflect the combined experiences and environmental exposures encountered during spaceflight. Telomere length (quantitative polymerase chain reaction and telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization) and telomerase activity (quantitative polymerase chain reaction -telomere repeat amplification protocol) were longitudinally assessed in the space- and earth-bound twins. Chromosome aberrations (directional genomic hybridization), signatures of radiation exposure, were also evaluated. RESULTS: The twins had relatively similar telomere lengths before spaceflight, and the earth-bound twins' telomeres remained relatively stable over the course of the study. Surprisingly, the space twins' telomeres were longer during spaceflight, and upon return to Earth shortened rapidly, resulting in many more short telomeres after spaceflight than before. Chromosomal signatures of space radiation exposure were also elevated during spaceflight, and increased inversion frequencies persisted after spaceflight, suggestive of ongoing genome instability. CONCLUSION: Although the definitive mechanisms underlying such dramatic spaceflight-associated shifts in telomere length remain unclear, improved maintenance of telomere length has important implications for aging science and improving healthspan for those on Earth, as well.",Luxton JJ; Bailey SM,,2021,Plastic and reconstructive surgery,Journal Article,
35856037,Recent transcriptomic studies to elucidate the plant adaptive response to spaceflight and to simulated space environments.,"Discovering the adaptation mechanisms of plants to the space environment is essential for supporting human space exploration. Transcriptomic analyses allow the identification of adaptation response pathways by detecting changes in gene expression at the global genome level caused by the main factors of the space environment, namely altered gravity and cosmic radiation. This article reviews transcriptomic studies carried out from plants grown in spaceflights and in different ground-based microgravity simulators. Despite differences in plant growth conditions, these studies have shown that cell wall remodeling, oxidative stress, defense response, and photosynthesis are common altered processes in plants grown under spaceflight conditions. European scientists have significantly contributed to the acquisition of this knowledge, e.g., by showing the role of red light in the adaptation response of plants (EMCS experiments) and the mechanisms of cellular response and adaptation mostly affecting cell cycle regulation, using cell cultures in microgravity simulators.",Manzano A; Carnero-Diaz E; Herranz R; Medina FJ,Microgravity sciences; Omics; Plant biology; Space sciences,2022,iScience,Journal Article; Review,
37012297,Skeletal muscle gene expression dysregulation in long-term spaceflights and aging is clock-dependent.,"The circadian clock regulates cellular and molecular processes in mammals across all tissues including skeletal muscle, one of the largest organs in the human body. Dysregulated circadian rhythms are characteristic of aging and crewed spaceflight, associated with, for example, musculoskeletal atrophy. Molecular insights into spaceflight-related alterations of circadian regulation in skeletal muscle are still missing. Here, we investigated potential functional consequences of clock disruptions on skeletal muscle using published omics datasets obtained from spaceflights and other clock-altering, external (fasting and exercise), or internal (aging) conditions on Earth. Our analysis identified alterations of the clock network and skeletal muscle-associated pathways, as a result of spaceflight duration in mice, which resembles aging-related gene expression changes observed in humans on Earth (e.g., ATF4 downregulation, associated with muscle atrophy). Furthermore, according to our results, external factors such as exercise or fasting lead to molecular changes in the core-clock network, which may compensate for the circadian disruption observed during spaceflights. Thus, maintaining circadian functioning is crucial to ameliorate unphysiological alterations and musculoskeletal atrophy reported among astronauts.",Malhan D; Yalçin M; Schoenrock B; Blottner D; Relógio A,,2023,NPJ microgravity,Journal Article,

One such concern is muscle atrophy, which is partly attributed to the dysregulation of calcium levels due to abnormalities in SERCA pump functioning. To identify potential biomarkers for this condition, multi-omics data and physiological data available on the NASA Open Science Data Repository (osdr.nasa.gov) were used, and machine learning methods were employed. Specifically, we used multi-omics (transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA methylation) data and calcium reuptake data collected from C57BL/6 J mouse soleus and tibialis anterior tissues during several 30+ day-long missions on the international space station. The QLattice symbolic regression algorithm was introduced to generate highly explainable models that predict either experimental conditions or calcium reuptake levels based on multi-omics features. The list of candidate models established by QLattice was used to identify key features contributing to the predictive capability of these models, with Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins found to be the most predictive biomarkers related to the resilience of the tibialis anterior muscle in space.

34502375,Mammalian and Invertebrate Models as Complementary Tools for Gaining Mechanistic Insight on Muscle Responses to Spaceflight.,"Bioinformatics approaches have proven useful in understanding biological responses to spaceflight. Spaceflight experiments remain resource intensive and rare. One outstanding issue is how to maximize scientific output from a limited number of omics datasets from traditional animal models including nematodes, fruitfly, and rodents. The utility of omics data from invertebrate models in anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight has not been fully explored. Hence, we performed comparative analyses of transcriptomes of soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) in mice that underwent 37 days of spaceflight. Results indicate shared stress responses and altered circadian rhythm. EDL showed more robust growth signals and Pde2a downregulation, possibly underlying its resistance to atrophy versus soleus. Spaceflight and hindlimb unloading mice shared differential regulation of proliferation, circadian, and neuronal signaling. Shared gene regulation in muscles of humans on bedrest and space flown rodents suggest targets for mitigating muscle atrophy in space and on Earth. Spaceflight responses of C. elegans were more similar to EDL. Discrete life stages of D. melanogaster have distinct utility in anticipating EDL and soleus responses. In summary, spaceflight leads to shared and discrete molecular responses between muscle types and invertebrate models may augment mechanistic knowledge gained from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies.",Cahill T; Cope H; Bass JJ; Overbey EG; Gilbert R; da Silveira WA; Paul AM; Mishra T; Herranz R; Reinsch SS; Costes SV; Hardiman G; Szewczyk NJ; Tahimic CGT,animal models; bedrest; cross-species comparison; hindlimb unloading; microgravity; muscle; spaceflight; transcriptomics,2021,International journal of molecular sciences,Journal Article,

We compared the transcriptome response of liver and quadriceps from mice on NASA RR1 mission, after 37 days of exposure to spaceflight using GSEA, ORA, and sparse partial least square-differential analysis. We found that lipid metabolism is the most affected biological process between the two organs. A specific gene cluster expression pattern in the liver strongly correlated with glucose sparing and an energy-saving response affecting high energy demand process gene expression such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation in the muscle. Our results show that impaired lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver and muscle atrophy gene expression are two paired events during spaceflight, for which dietary changes represent a possible countermeasure.",Vitry G; Finch R; Mcstay G; Behesti A; Déjean S; Larose T; Wotring V; da Silveira WA,Astronautics; Omics; Space medicine; Space sciences,2022,iScience,Journal Article,
38581556,Telomeres and aging: on and off the planet!,"Improving human healthspan in our rapidly aging population has never been more imperative. Telomeres, protective ""caps"" at the ends of linear chromosomes, are essential for maintaining genome stability of eukaryotic genomes. Due to their physical location and the ""end-replication problem"" first envisioned by Dr. Alexey Olovnikov, telomeres shorten with cell division, the implications of which are remarkably profound. Telomeres are hallmarks and molecular drivers of aging, as well as fundamental integrating components of the cumulative effects of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors that erode telomere length over time. Ongoing telomere attrition and the resulting limit to replicative potential imposed by cellular senescence serves a powerful tumor suppressor function, and also underlies aging and a spectrum of age-related degenerative pathologies, including reduced fertility, dementias, cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, very little data exists regarding the extraordinary stressors and exposures associated with long-duration space exploration and eventual habitation of other planets, nor how such missions will influence telomeres, reproduction, health, disease risk, and aging. Here, we briefly review our current understanding, which has advanced significantly in recent years as a result of the NASA Twins Study, the most comprehensive evaluation of human health effects associated with spaceflight ever conducted. Thus, the Twins Study is at the forefront of personalized space medicine approaches for astronauts and sets the stage for subsequent missions.

37887314,Spaceflight Induces Strength Decline in Caenorhabditis elegans.,"Background: Understanding and countering the well-established negative health consequences of spaceflight remains a primary challenge preventing safe deep space exploration. Targeted/personalized therapeutics are at the forefront of space medicine strategies, and cross-species molecular signatures now define the 'typical' spaceflight response. However, a lack of direct genotype-phenotype associations currently limits the robustness and, therefore, the therapeutic utility of putative mechanisms underpinning pathological changes in flight. Methods: We employed the worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a validated model of space biology, combined with 'NemaFlex-S' microfluidic devices for assessing animal strength production as one of the most reproducible physiological responses to spaceflight. Wild-type and dys-1 (BZ33) strains (a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model for comparing predisposed muscle weak animals) were cultured on the International Space Station in chemically defined media before loading second-generation gravid adults into NemaFlex-S devices to assess individual animal strength. These same cultures were then frozen on orbit before returning to Earth for next-generation sequencing transcriptomic analysis. Results: Neuromuscular strength was lower in flight versus ground controls (16.6% decline, p < 0.05), with dys-1 significantly more (23% less strength, p < 0.01) affected than wild types. The transcriptional gene ontology signatures characterizing both strains of weaker animals in flight strongly corroborate previous results across species, enriched for upregulated stress response pathways and downregulated mitochondrial and cytoskeletal processes. Functional gene cluster analysis extended this to implicate decreased neuronal function, including abnormal calcium handling and acetylcholine signaling, in space-induced strength declines under the predicted control of UNC-89 and DAF-19 transcription factors. Finally, gene modules specifically altered in dys-1 animals in flight again cluster to neuronal/neuromuscular pathways, suggesting strength loss in DMD comprises a strong neuronal component that predisposes these animals to exacerbated strength loss in space. Conclusions: Highly reproducible gene signatures are strongly associated with space-induced neuromuscular strength loss across species and neuronal changes in calcium/acetylcholine signaling require further study. These results promote targeted medical efforts towards and provide an in vivo model for safely sending animals and people into deep space in the near future.",Soni P; Edwards H; Anupom T; Rahman M; Lesanpezeshki L; Blawzdziewicz J; Cope H; Gharahdaghi N; Scott D; Toh LS; Williams PM; Etheridge T; Szewczyk N; Willis CRG; Vanapalli SA,C. elegans; International Space Station; astropharmacy; dystrophin; gene expression; microgravity; muscle atrophy; muscle strength; omics; spaceflight,2023,Cells,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","P40 OD010440/OD/NIH HHS/United States; NNX15AL16GG, NNJ15GK01C, NSSC22K0250, NSSC22K0278/NASA/NASA/United States; BB/N015894/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United"
33376973,Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and Exosome Profiling from a Year-Long Human Spaceflight Reveals Circulating Biomarkers.,"Liquid biopsies based on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) or exosomes provide a noninvasive approach to monitor human health and disease but have not been utilized for astronauts. Here, we profile cfDNA characteristics, including fragment size, cellular deconvolution, and nucleosome positioning, in an astronaut during a year-long mission on the International Space Station, compared to his identical twin on Earth and healthy donors. We observed a significant increase in the proportion of cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA) inflight, and analysis of post-flight exosomes in plasma revealed a 30-fold increase in circulating exosomes and patient-specific protein cargo (including brain-derived peptides) after the year-long mission. This longitudinal analysis of astronaut cfDNA during spaceflight and the exosome profiles highlights their utility for astronaut health monitoring, as well as cf-mtDNA levels as a potential biomarker for physiological stress or immune system responses related to microgravity, radiation exposure, and the other unique environmental conditions of spaceflight.",Bezdan D; Grigorev K; Meydan C; Pelissier Vatter FA; Cioffi M; Rao V; MacKay M; Nakahira K; Burnham P; Afshinnekoo E; Westover C; Butler D; Mozsary C; Donahoe T; Foox J; Mishra T; Lucotti S; Rana BK; Melnick AM; Zhang H; Matei I; Kelsen D; Yu K; Lyden DC; Taylor L; Bailey SM; Snyder MP; Garrett-Bakelman FE; Ossowski S; De Vlaminck I; Mason CE,Omics; Space Medicine,2020,iScience,Journal Article,R01 MH117406/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States; R01 AI125416/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; R01 ES021006/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States; P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R21 AI129851/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; KL2 TR002385/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States; R01 NS076465/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States; R25 EB020393/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States; R01 AI151059/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States
35328492,The Fight against Cancer by Microgravity: The Multicellular Spheroid as a Metastasis Model.,"Cancer is a disease exhibiting uncontrollable cell growth and spreading to other parts of the organism. It is a heavy, worldwide burden for mankind with high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, groundbreaking research and innovations are necessary. Research in space under microgravity (µg) conditions is a novel approach with the potential to fight cancer and develop future cancer therapies. Space travel is accompanied by adverse effects on our health, and there is a need to counteract these health problems. On the cellular level, studies have shown that real (r-) and simulated (s-) µg impact survival, apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and adhesion as well as the cytoskeleton, the extracellular matrix, focal adhesion, and growth factors in cancer cells. Moreover, the µg-environment induces in vitro 3D tumor models (multicellular spheroids and organoids) with a high potential for preclinical drug targeting, cancer drug development, and studying the processes of cancer progression and metastasis on a molecular level. This review focuses on the effects of r- and s-µg on different types of cells deriving from thyroid, breast, lung, skin, and prostate cancer, as well as tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, we summarize the current knowledge of the impact of µg on cancerous stem cells.

34966726,The Future of Personalized Medicine in Space: From Observations to Countermeasures.,"The aim of personalized medicine is to detach from a ""one-size fits all approach"" and improve patient health by individualization to achieve the best outcomes in disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Technological advances in sequencing, improved knowledge of omics, integration with bioinformatics and new in vitro testing formats, have enabled personalized medicine to become a reality. Individual variation in response to environmental factors can affect susceptibility to disease and response to treatments. Space travel exposes humans to environmental stressors that lead to physiological adaptations, from altered cell behavior to abnormal tissue responses, including immune system impairment. In the context of human space flight research, human health studies have shown a significant inter-individual variability in response to space analogue conditions. A substantial degree of variability has been noticed in response to medications (from both an efficacy and toxicity perspective) as well as in susceptibility to damage from radiation exposure and in physiological changes such as loss of bone mineral density and muscle mass in response to deconditioning. At present, personalized medicine for astronauts is limited. With the advent of longer duration missions beyond low Earth orbit, it is imperative that space agencies adopt a personalized strategy for each astronaut, starting from pre-emptive personalized pre-clinical approaches through to individualized countermeasures to minimize harmful physiological changes and find targeted treatment for disease. Advances in space medicine can also be translated to terrestrial applications, and vice versa. This review places the astronaut at the center of personalized medicine, will appraise existing evidence and future preclinical tools as well as clinical, ethical and legal considerations for future space travel.

35037812,Latest knowledge about changes in the proteome in microgravity.,"INTRODUCTION: A long-term stay of humans in space causes health problems and changes in protists and plants. Deep space exploration will increase the time humans or rodents will spend in microgravity (µg). Moreover, they are exposed to cosmic radiation, hypodynamia, and isolation. OMICS investigations will increase our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of µg-induced alterations in vivo and in vitro. AREAS COVERED: We summarize the findings over the recent 3 years on µg-induced changes in the proteome of protists, plants, rodent, and human cells. Considering the thematic orientation of microgravity-related publications in that time frame, we focus on medicine-associated findings, such as the µg-induced antibiotic resistance of bacteria, the myocardial consequences of µg-induced calpain activation, and the role of MMP13 in osteoarthritis. All these point to the fact that µg is an extreme stressor that could not be evolutionarily addressed on Earth. EXPERT OPINION: In conclusion, when interpreting µg-experiments, the direct, mostly unspecific stress response, must be distinguished from specific µg-effects. For this reason, recent studies often do not consider single protein findings but place them in the context of protein-protein interactions. This enables an estimation of functional relationships, especially if these are supported by epigenetic and transcriptional data (multi-omics).",Schulz H; Strauch SM; Richter P; Wehland M; Krüger M; Sahana J; Corydon TJ; Wise P; Baran R; Lebert M; Grimm D,Real microgravity; cancer; human cells; plants; proteome; rodents; simulated microgravity,2022,Expert review of proteomics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
26834514,Incorporation of omics analyses into artificial gravity research for space exploration countermeasure development.,"The next major steps in human spaceflight include flyby, orbital, and landing missions to the Moon, Mars, and near earth asteroids. The first crewed deep space mission is expected to launch in 2022, which affords less than 7 years to address the complex question of whether and how to apply artificial gravity to counter the effects of prolonged weightlessness. Various phenotypic changes are demonstrated during artificial gravity experiments. However, the molecular dynamics (genotype and molecular phenotypes) that underlie these morphological, physiological, and behavioral phenotypes are far more complex than previously understood. Thus, targeted molecular assessment of subjects under various G conditions can be expected to miss important patterns of molecular variance that inform the more general phenotypes typically being measured. Use of omics methods can help detect changes across broad molecular networks, as various G-loading paradigms are applied. This will be useful in detecting off-target, or unanticipated effects of the different gravity paradigms applied to humans or animals. Insights gained from these approaches may eventually be used to inform countermeasure development or refine the deployment of existing countermeasures. This convergence of the omics and artificial gravity research communities may be critical if we are to develop the proper artificial gravity solutions under the severely compressed timelines currently established. Thus, the omics community may offer a unique ability to accelerate discovery, provide new insights, and benefit deep space missions in ways that have not been previously considered.",Schmidt MA; Goodwin TJ; Pelligra R,Artificial gravity; Astronaut; Countermeasures; Gravity; Omics; Space flight,2016,Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society,Journal Article; Review,
35207523,Smart Device-Driven Corticolimbic Plasticity in Cognitive-Emotional Restructuring of Space-Related Neuropsychiatric Disease and Injury.,"Escalating government and commercial efforts to plan and deploy viable manned near-to-deep solar system exploration and habitation over the coming decades now drives next-generation space medicine innovations. The application of cutting-edge precision medicine, such as brain stimulation techniques, provides powerful clinical and field/flight situation methods to selectively control vagal tone and neuroendocrine-modulated corticolimbic plasticity, which is affected by prolonged cosmic radiation exposure, social isolation or crowding, and weightlessness in constricted operational non-terran locales. Earth-based clinical research demonstrates that brain stimulation approaches may be combined with novel psychotherapeutic integrated memory structure rationales for the corrective reconsolidation of arousing or emotional experiences, autobiographical memories, semantic schema, and other cognitive structures to enhance neuropsychiatric patient outcomes. Such smart cotherapies or countermeasures, which exploit natural, pharmaceutical, and minimally invasive neuroprosthesis-driven nervous system activity, may optimize the cognitive-emotional restructuring of astronauts suffering from space-related neuropsychiatric disease and injury, including mood, affect, and anxiety symptoms of any potential severity and pathophysiology. An appreciation of improved neuropsychiatric healthcare through the merging of new or rediscovered smart theragnostic medical technologies, capable of rendering personalized neuroplasticity training and managed psychotherapeutic treatment protocols, will reveal deeper insights into the illness states experienced by astronauts. Future work in this area should emphasize the ethical role of telemedicine and/or digital clinicians to advance the (semi)autonomous, technology-assisted medical prophylaxis, diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and compliance of astronauts for elevated health, safety, and performance in remote extreme space and extraterrestrial environments.",Clark KB,astronaut health; cognitive-emotional restructuring; corticolimbic plasticity; neuropsychiatric disease and injury; smart medical devices; space theragnostic medicine,2022,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",Journal Article; Review,
36070701,Artificial gravity partially protects space-induced neurological deficits in Drosophila melanogaster.,"Spaceflight poses risks to the central nervous system (CNS), and understanding neurological responses is important for future missions. We report CNS changes in Drosophila aboard the International Space Station in response to spaceflight microgravity (SFμg) and artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g) via inflight centrifugation as a countermeasure. While inflight behavioral analyses of SFμg exhibit increased activity, postflight analysis displays significant climbing defects, highlighting the sensitivity of behavior to altered gravity. Multi-omics analysis shows alterations in metabolic, oxidative stress and synaptic transmission pathways in both SFμg and SF1g; however, neurological changes immediately postflight, including neuronal loss, glial cell count alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, are seen only in SFμg. Additionally, progressive neuronal loss and a glial phenotype in SF1g and SFμg brains, with pronounced phenotypes in SFμg, are seen upon acclimation to Earth conditions. Overall, our results indicate that artificial gravity partially protects the CNS from the adverse effects of spaceflight.",Mhatre SD; Iyer J; Petereit J; Dolling-Boreham RM; Tyryshkina A; Paul AM; Gilbert R; Jensen M; Woolsey RJ; Anand S; Sowa MB; Quilici DR; Costes SV; Girirajan S; Bhattacharya S,CP: Neuroscience; Drosophila; ISS; acclimation; artificial gravity; brain morphology; microgravity; oxidative stress; spaceflight,2022,Cell reports,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",P20 GM103440/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States
28433608,Toward biotechnology in space: High-throughput instruments for in situ biological research beyond Earth.,"Space biotechnology is a nascent field aimed at applying tools of modern biology to advance our goals in space exploration. These advances rely on our ability to exploit in situ high throughput techniques for amplification and sequencing DNA, and measuring levels of RNA transcripts, proteins and metabolites in a cell. These techniques, collectively known as ""omics"" techniques have already revolutionized terrestrial biology. A number of on-going efforts are aimed at developing instruments to carry out ""omics"" research in space, in particular on board the International Space Station and small satellites. For space applications these instruments require substantial and creative reengineering that includes automation, miniaturization and ensuring that the device is resistant to conditions in space and works independently of the direction of the gravity vector. Different paths taken to meet these requirements for different ""omics"" instruments are the subjects of this review. The advantages and disadvantages of these instruments and technological solutions and their level of readiness for deployment in space are discussed. Considering that effects of space environments on terrestrial organisms appear to be global, it is argued that high throughput instruments are essential to advance (1) biomedical and physiological studies to control and reduce space-related stressors on living systems, (2) application of biology to life support and in situ resource utilization, (3) planetary protection, and (4) basic research about the limits on life in space. It is also argued that carrying out measurements in situ provides considerable advantages over the traditional space biology paradigm that relies on post-flight data analysis.",Karouia F; Peyvan K; Pohorille A,"Biotechnology; Exploration; Genomics; High-throughput; Metabolomics; Microarray; Omics; Spaceflight; Transcriptomics, Proteomics",2017,Biotechnology advances,Journal Article; Review,

However, the space environment presents stressors that include radiation, microgravity, and isolation. Understanding how these factors affect biology is crucial for safe and effective crewed space exploration. There is a need to develop countermeasures, to adapt plants and microbes for nutrient sources and bioregenerative life support, and to limit pathogen infection. Scientists across the world are conducting space omics experiments on model organisms and, more recently, on humans. Optimal extraction of actionable scientific discoveries from these precious datasets will only occur at the collective level with improved standardization. To address this shortcoming, we established ISSOP (International Standards for Space Omics Processing), an international consortium of scientists who aim to enhance standard guidelines between space biologists at a global level.

However, most existing methods focus on modeling dynamics of single cells while ignore microenvironments (MEs). Here we present SOTIP (Spatial Omics mulTIPle-task analysis), a versatile method incorporating MEs and their interrelationships into a unified graph. Based on this graph, spatial heterogeneity quantification, spatial domain identification, differential microenvironment analysis, and other downstream tasks can be performed. We validate each module's accuracy, robustness, scalability and interpretability on various spatial omics datasets. In two independent mouse cerebral cortex spatial transcriptomics datasets, we reveal a gradient spatial heterogeneity pattern strongly correlated with the cortical depth. In human triple-negative breast cancer spatial proteomics datasets, we identify molecular polarizations and MEs associated with different patient survivals. Overall, by modeling biologically explainable MEs, SOTIP outperforms state-of-art methods and provides some perspectives for spatial omics data exploration and interpretation.",Yuan Z; Li Y; Shi M; Yang F; Gao J; Yao J; Zhang MQ,,2022,Nature communications,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
34647245,Plant Gravitropism: From Mechanistic Insights into Plant Function on Earth to Plants Colonizing Other Worlds.,"Gravitropism, the growth of roots and shoots toward or away from the direction of gravity, has been studied for centuries. Such studies have not only led to a better understanding of the gravitropic process itself, but also paved new paths leading to deeper mechanistic insights into a wide range of research areas. These include hormone biology, cell signal transduction, regulation of gene expression, plant evolution, and plant interactions with a variety of environmental stimuli. In addition to contributions to basic knowledge about how plants function, there is accumulating evidence that gravitropism confers adaptive advantages to crops, particularly under marginal agricultural soils. Therefore, gravitropism is emerging as a breeding target for enhancing agricultural productivity. Moreover, research on gravitropism has spawned several studies on plant growth in microgravity that have enabled researchers to uncouple the effects of gravity from other tropisms. Although rapid progress on understanding gravitropism witnessed during the past decade continues to be driven by traditional molecular, physiological, and cell biological tools, these tools have been enriched by technological innovations in next-generation omics platforms and microgravity analog facilities. In this chapter, we review the field of gravitropism by highlighting recent landmark studies that have provided unique insights into this classic research topic while also discussing potential contributions to agriculture on Earth and beyond.",Chin S; Blancaflor EB,Agriculture; Genomics; Microgravity; Root development; Spaceflight; Tropisms,2022,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Review",
32867906,Promoting Tech Transfer Between Space and Global Mental Health.,"INTRODUCTION: Numerous issues in mental health benefit from technological innovation. An example involves the mental health challenges of long-duration spaceflight (such as a Mars mission), including prolonged confinement, microgravity, and different sunlight exposure lengths. Persisting on Earth are global mental health challenges stemming from disease burdens, limited interview-based diagnostic systems, trial-and-error treatment approaches, and suboptimal access. There is potential for cross-pollinating solutions between these seemingly disparate challenges using a range of emerging technologies such as sensors, omics, and big data. In this review, we highlight the bidirectional value of mental health technology transfer aimed to address issues both on Earth and in space.METHODS: We prepared a systematic review of studies pertaining to mental health technological innovation and space medicine.RESULTS: For Earth mental health technologies translatable to long-duration space missions, we cite several example technologies, including device-based psychotherapy and social support, conversational agents aka chatbots, and nutritional and physical activity focused mental health. Space technologies translatable to Earth mental health include remote sensing devices, global navigation satellite systems, satellite communications, chronotherapies, and nutritional advances.DISCUSSION: There is a rich history of space technologies informing Earth technological trends, including general health care on Earth, and vice versa. To avoid the traditional happenstance approach that results in delays, missed opportunities, and increased cost, and to improve outcomes for both Earth and space utilization of these technologies, we propose increased dialogue and training opportunities to enhance innovation and outcomes.Chang DD, Storch EA, Black L, Berk M, Pellis N, Lavretsky H, Sutton J, Ternes K, Shepanek M, Smith E, Abbott R, Eyre HA.

26917741,Transient gene and microRNA expression profile changes of confluent human fibroblast cells in spaceflight.,"Microgravity, or an altered gravity environment different from the 1 g of the Earth, has been shown to influence global gene expression patterns and protein levels in cultured cells. However, most of the reported studies that have been conducted in space or by using simulated microgravity on the ground have focused on the growth or differentiation of these cells. It has not been specifically addressed whether nonproliferating cultured cells will sense the presence of microgravity in space. In an experiment conducted onboard the International Space Station, confluent human fibroblast cells were fixed after being cultured in space for 3 and 14 d, respectively, to investigate changes in gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in these cells. Results of the experiment showed that on d 3, both the flown and ground cells were still proliferating slowly, as measured by the percentage of Ki-67(+) cells. Gene and miRNA expression data indicated activation of NF-κB and other growth-related pathways that involve hepatocyte growth factor and VEGF as well as the down-regulation of the Let-7 miRNA family. On d 14, when the cells were mostly nonproliferating, the gene and miRNA expression profile of the flight sample was indistinguishable from that of the ground sample. Comparison of gene and miRNA expressions in the d 3 samples, with respect to d 14, revealed that most of the changes observed on d 3 were related to cell growth for both the flown and ground cells. Analysis of cytoskeletal changes via immunohistochemistry staining of the cells with antibodies for α-tubulin and fibronectin showed no difference between the flown and ground samples. Taken together, our study suggests that in true nondividing human fibroblast cells in culture, microgravity experienced in space has little effect on gene and miRNA expression profiles.-Zhang, Y., Lu, T., Wong, M., Wang, X., Stodieck, L., Karouia, F., Story, M., Wu, H.

25517942,Spaceflight induces specific alterations in the proteomes of Arabidopsis.,"Life in spaceflight demonstrates remarkable acclimation processes within the specialized habitats of vehicles subjected to the myriad of unique environmental issues associated with orbital trajectories. To examine the response processes that occur in plants in space, leaves and roots from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings from three GFP reporter lines that were grown from seed for 12 days on the International Space Station and preserved on orbit in RNAlater were returned to Earth and analyzed by using iTRAQ broad-scale proteomics procedures. Using stringent criteria, we identified over 1500 proteins, which included 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins we were able to accurately quantify. Quantification revealed 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins that showed statistically significant differential abundance in the spaceflight samples compared to ground controls, with few proteins differentially regulated in common between leaves and roots. This indicates that there are measurable proteomics responses to spaceflight and that the responses are organ-specific. These proteomics data were compared with transcriptome data from similar spaceflight samples, showing that there is a positive but limited relationship between transcriptome and proteome regulation of the overall spaceflight responses of plants. These results are discussed in terms of emergence understanding of plant responses to spaceflight particularly with regard to cell wall remodeling, as well as in the context of deriving multiple omics data sets from a single on-orbit preservation and operations approach.",Ferl RJ; Koh J; Denison F; Paul AL,,2015,Astrobiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",
33163940,The Importance of Earth Reference Controls in Spaceflight -Omics Research: Characterization of Nucleolin Mutants from the Seedling Growth Experiments.,"Understanding plant adaptive responses to the space environment is a requisite for enabling space farming. Spaceflight produces deleterious effects on plant cells, particularly affecting ribosome biogenesis, a complex stress-sensitive process coordinated with cell division and differentiation, known to be activated by red light. Here, in a series of ground studies, we have used mutants from the two Arabidopsis nucleolin genes (NUC1 and NUC2, nucleolar regulators of ribosome biogenesis) to better understand their role in adaptive response mechanisms to stress on Earth. Thus, we show that nucleolin stress-related gene NUC2 can compensate for the environmental stress provided by darkness in nuc1 plants, whereas nuc2 plants are not able to provide a complete response to red light. These ground control findings, as part of the ESA/NASA Seedling Growth spaceflight experiments, will determine the basis for the identification of genetic backgrounds enabling an adaptive advantage for plants in future space experiments.",Manzano A; Villacampa A; Sáez-Vásquez J; Kiss JZ; Medina FJ; Herranz R,Arabidopsis; Ground controls; Nucleolus; Omics; Plant Biology; RNA-Seq; Space Sciences; Spaceflight; Stress response,2020,iScience,Journal Article,80NSSC17K0546/ImNASA/Intramural NASA/United States
37164076,Adaptive mechanisms of Bacillus to near space extreme environments.,"Earth's near space is an extreme atmosphere environment with high levels of radiation, low atmospheric pressure and dramatic temperature fluctuations. The region is above the flight altitude of aircraft but below the orbit of satellites, which has special and Mars-like conditions for investigating the survival and evolution of life. Technical limitations including flight devices, payloads and technologies/methodologies hinder microbiological research in near space. In this study, we investigated microbial survival and adaptive strategies in near space using a scientific balloon fight mission and multi-omics analyses. Methods for sample preparation, storage, protector and vessel were optimized to prepare the exposed microbial samples. After 3 h 17 min of exposure at a float altitude of ~32 km, only Bacillus strains were alive with survival efficiencies of 0-10(-6). Diverse mutants with significantly altered metabolites were generated, firstly proving that Earth's near space could be used as a new powerful microbial breeding platform. Multi-omics analyses of mutants revealed cascade changes at the genome, transcriptome and proteome levels. In response to environmental stresses, two mutants had similar proteome changes caused by different genomic mutations and mRNA expression levels. Metabolic network analysis combined with proteins' expression levels revealed that metabolic fluxes of EMP, PPP and purine synthesis-related pathways were significantly altered to increase/decrease inosine production. Further analysis showed that proteins related to translation, molecular chaperones, cell wall/membrane, sporulation, DNA replication/repair and anti-oxidation were significantly upregulated, enabling cells to efficiently repair DNA/protein damages and improve viability against environmental stress. Overall, these results revealed genetic and metabolic responses of Bacillus to the harsh conditions in near space, providing a research basis for bacterial adaptive mechanisms in extreme environments.",Deng A; Wang T; Wang J; Li L; Wang X; Liu L; Wen T,Adaptive mechanism; Bacillus; Genome; Near space; Proteome; Transcriptome,2023,The Science of the total environment,Journal Article,
24273472,Personalized medicine in human space flight: using Omics based analyses to develop individualized countermeasures that enhance astronaut safety and performance.,"Space flight is one of the most extreme conditions encountered by humans. Advances in Omics methodologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) have revealed that unique differences exist between individuals. These differences can be amplified in extreme conditions, such as space flight. A better understanding of individual differences may allow us to develop personalized countermeasure packages that optimize the safety and performance of each astronaut. In this review, we explore the role of ""Omics"" in advancing our ability to: (1) more thoroughly describe the biological response of humans in space; (2) describe molecular attributes of individual astronauts that alter the risk profile prior to entering the space environment; (3) deploy Omics techniques in the development of personalized countermeasures; and (4) develop a comprehensive Omics-based assessment and countermeasure platform that will guide human space flight in the future. In this review, we advance the concept of personalized medicine in human space flight, with the goal of enhancing astronaut safety and performance. Because the field is vast, we explore selected examples where biochemical individuality might significantly impact countermeasure development. These include gene and small molecule variants associated with: (1) metabolism of therapeutic drugs used in space; (2) one carbon metabolism and DNA stability; (3) iron metabolism, oxidative stress and damage, and DNA stability; and (4) essential input (Mg and Zn) effects on DNA repair. From these examples, we advance the case that widespread Omics profiling should serve as the foundation for aerospace medicine and research, explore methodological considerations to advance the field, and suggest why personalized medicine may become the standard of care for humans in space.",Schmidt MA; Goodwin TJ,Astronaut health; DNA repair; DNA stability; Essential inputs; Exploration; Genomics; Human; Human performance; Metabolomics; Micronutrient; Omics; Oxidative stress; Personalized medicine; Proteomics; Single nucleotide polymorphism; Space flight; Systems biology; Transcriptomics,2013,Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society,Journal Article,
26734055,A Bird's-Eye View of Molecular Changes in Plant Gravitropism Using Omics Techniques.,"During evolution, plants have developed mechanisms to adapt to a variety of environmental stresses, including drought, high salinity, changes in carbon dioxide levels and pathogens. Central signaling hubs and pathways that are regulated in response to these stimuli have been identified. In contrast to these well studied environmental stimuli, changes in transcript, protein and metabolite levels in response to a gravitational stimulus are less well understood. Amyloplasts, localized in statocytes of the root tip, in mesophyll cells of coleoptiles and in the elongation zone of the growing internodes comprise statoliths in higher plants. Deviations of the statocytes with respect to the earthly gravity vector lead to a displacement of statoliths relative to the cell due to their inertia and thus to gravity perception. Downstream signaling events, including the conversion from the biophysical signal of sedimentation of distinct heavy mass to a biochemical signal, however, remain elusive. More recently, technical advances, including clinostats, drop towers, parabolic flights, satellites, and the International Space Station, allowed researchers to study the effect of altered gravity conditions - real and simulated micro- as well as hypergravity on plants. This allows for a unique opportunity to study plant responses to a purely anthropogenic stress for which no evolutionary program exists. Furthermore, the requirement for plants as food and oxygen sources during prolonged manned space explorations led to an increased interest in the identi-fication of genes involved in the adaptation of plants to microgravity. Transcriptomic, proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and metabolomic profiling strategies provide a sensitive high-throughput approach to identify biochemical alterations in response to changes with respect to the influence of the gravitational vector and thus the acting gravitational force on the transcript, protein and metabolite level.

30688299,Exploring the Effects of Spaceflight on Mouse Physiology using the Open Access NASA GeneLab Platform.,"Performing biological experiments in space requires special accommodations and procedures to ensure that these investigations are performed effectively and efficiently. Moreover, given the infrequency of these experiments it is imperative that their impacts be maximized. The rapid advancement of omics technologies offers an opportunity to dramatically increase the volume of data produced from precious spaceflight specimens. To capitalize on this, NASA has developed the GeneLab platform to provide unrestricted access to spaceflight omics data and encourage its widespread analysis. Rodents (both rats and mice) are common model organisms used by scientists to investigate space-related biological impacts. The enclosure that house rodents during spaceflight are called Rodent Habitats (formerly Animal Enclosure Modules), and are substantially different from standard vivarium cages in their dimensions, air flow, and access to water and food. In addition, due to environmental and atmospheric conditions on the International Space Station (ISS), animals are exposed to a higher CO2 concentration. We recently reported that mice in the Rodent Habitats experience large changes in their transcriptome irrespective of whether animals were on the ground or in space. Furthermore, these changes were consistent with a hypoxic response, potentially driven by higher CO2 concentrations. Here we describe how a typical rodent experiment is performed in space, how omics data from these experiments can be accessed through the GeneLab platform, and how to identify key factors in this data. Using this process, any individual can make critical discoveries that could change the design of future space missions and activities.",Beheshti A; Shirazi-Fard Y; Choi S; Berrios D; Gebre SG; Galazka JM; Costes SV,,2019,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Video-Audio Media",

This large collection of data enables the exploration of molecular network responses to space environments using a systems biology approach. We review here the various components of the GeneLab platform, including the new data repository web interface, and the GeneLab Online Data Entry (GEODE) web portal, which will support the expansion of the database in the future to include companion non-omics assay data. We discuss our design for GEODE, particularly how it promotes investigators providing more accurate metadata, reducing the curation effort required of GeneLab staff. We also introduce here a new GeneLab Application Programming Interface (API) specifically designed to support tools for the visualization of processed omics data. We review the outreach efforts by GeneLab to utilize the spaceflight data in the repository to generate novel discoveries and develop new hypotheses, including spearheading data analysis working groups, and a high school student training program.

38550927,Optimizing human performance in extreme environments through precision medicine: From spaceflight to high-performance operations on Earth.,"Humans operating in extreme environments often conduct their operations at the edges of the limits of human performance. Sometimes, they are required to push these limits to previously unattained levels. As a result, their margins for error in execution are much smaller than that found in the general public. These same small margins for error that impact execution may also impact risk, safety, health, and even survival. Thus, humans operating in extreme environments have a need for greater refinement in their preparation, training, fitness, and medical care. Precision medicine (PM) is uniquely suited to address the needs of those engaged in these extreme operations because of its depth of molecular analysis, derived precision countermeasures, and ability to match each individual (and his or her specific molecular phenotype) with any given operating context (environment). Herein, we present an overview of a systems approach to PM in extreme environments, which affords clinicians one method to contextualize the inputs, processes, and outputs that can form the basis of a formal practice. For the sake of brevity, this overview is focused on molecular dynamics, while providing only a brief introduction to the also important physiologic and behavioral phenotypes in PM. Moreover, rather than a full review, it highlights important concepts, while using only selected citations to illustrate those concepts. It further explores, by demonstration, the basic principles of using functionally characterized molecular networks to guide the practical application of PM in extreme environments. At its core, PM in extreme environments is about attention to incremental gains and losses in molecular network efficiency that can scale to produce notable changes in health and performance. The aim of this overview is to provide a conceptual overview of one approach to PM in extreme environments, coupled with a selected suite of practical considerations for molecular profiling and countermeasures.",Schmidt MA; Jones JA; Mason CE,multi-omics; pharmacogenomics; precision medicine; preventive medicine; therapeutic innovations,2023,Cambridge prisms.

Members of NASA GeneLab and GeneLab-associated analysis working groups (AWGs) have developed a consensus pipeline for analyzing short-read RNA-sequencing data from spaceflight-associated experiments. The pipeline includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification steps, culminating in the detection of differentially expressed genes. This data analysis pipeline and the results of its execution using data submitted to GeneLab are now all publicly available through the GeneLab database. We present here the full details and rationale for the construction of this pipeline in order to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of pipeline data; to provide a template for data processing of future spaceflight-relevant datasets; and to encourage cross-analysis of data from other databases with the data available in GeneLab.",Overbey EG; Saravia-Butler AM; Zhang Z; Rathi KS; Fogle H; da Silveira WA; Barker RJ; Bass JJ; Beheshti A; Berrios DC; Blaber EA; Cekanaviciute E; Costa HA; Davin LB; Fisch KM; Gebre SG; Geniza M; Gilbert R; Gilroy S; Hardiman G; Herranz R; Kidane YH; Kruse CPS; Lee MD; Liefeld T; Lewis NG; McDonald JT; Meller R; Mishra T; Perera IY; Ray S; Reinsch SS; Rosenthal SB; Strong M; Szewczyk NJ; Tahimic CGT; Taylor DM; Vandenbrink JP; Villacampa A; Weging S; Wolverton C; Wyatt SE; Zea L; Costes SV; Galazka JM,Omics; Space Sciences,2021,iScience,Journal Article,R50 CA243876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States

It is essential to have a detailed understanding of the biological effects on humans living and working in deep space. Ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) is a major health risk factor for astronauts on extended missions outside the protective effects of the Earth's magnetic field. Currently, there are gaps in our knowledge of the health risks associated with chronic low-dose, low-dose-rate ionizing radiation, specifically ions associated with high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E). The NASA GeneLab project ( https://genelab.nasa.gov/ ) aims to provide a detailed library of omics datasets associated with biological samples exposed to HZE. The GeneLab Data System (GLDS) includes datasets from both spaceflight and ground-based studies, a majority of which involve exposure to ionizing radiation. In addition to detailed information on radiation exposure for ground-based studies, GeneLab is adding detailed, curated dosimetry information for spaceflight experiments. GeneLab is the first comprehensive omics database for space-related research from which an investigator can generate hypotheses to direct future experiments, utilizing both ground and space biological radiation data. The GLDS is continually expanding as omics-related data are generated by the space life sciences community.

32265943,Test of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome: A Discovery Environment to Explore Multiple Plant Biology Spaceflight Experiments.,"Recent advances in the routine access to space along with increasing opportunities to perform plant growth experiments on board the International Space Station have led to an ever-increasing body of transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data from plants experiencing spaceflight. These datasets hold great promise to help understand how plant biology reacts to this unique environment. However, analyses that mine across such expanses of data are often complex to implement, being impeded by the sheer number of potential comparisons that are possible. Complexities in how the output of these multiple parallel analyses can be presented to the researcher in an accessible and intuitive form provides further barriers to such research. Recent developments in computational systems biology have led to rapid advances in interactive data visualization environments designed to perform just such tasks. However, to date none of these tools have been tailored to the analysis of the broad-ranging plant biology spaceflight data. We have therefore developed the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database (https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast) to address this gap in our capabilities. TOAST is a relational database that uses the Qlik database management software to link plant biology, spaceflight-related omics datasets, and their associated metadata. This environment helps visualize relationships across multiple levels of experiments in an easy to use gene-centric platform. TOAST draws on data from The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) GeneLab and other data repositories and also connects results to a suite of web-based analytical tools to facilitate further investigation of responses to spaceflight and related stresses. The TOAST graphical user interface allows for quick comparisons between plant spaceflight experiments using real-time, gene-specific queries, or by using functional gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, or other filtering systems to explore genetic networks of interest. Testing of the database shows that TOAST confirms patterns of gene expression already highlighted in the literature, such as revealing the modulation of oxidative stress-related responses across multiple plant spaceflight experiments. However, this data exploration environment can also drive new insights into patterns of spaceflight responsive gene expression. For example, TOAST analyses highlight changes to mitochondrial function as likely shared responses in many plant spaceflight experiments.",Barker R; Lombardino J; Rasmussen K; Gilroy S,Arabidopsis thaliana; Qlik; RNAseq; bioinformatics; microarray; proteomics; spaceflight; transcriptomics,2020,Frontiers in plant science,Journal Article,

This study compared the transcriptomic response of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis flown in space with corresponding transcriptomes derived from 2-D clinostat (High Aspect Ratio Vessel: HARV) experiments performed under the same conditions of bacterial strain, growth medium, temperature, and incubation time. High-quality total RNA (RNA Integrity Number >9.6) was isolated from multiple biological replicates from each treatment, transcripts were quantified by RNA-seq, and raw data was processed through a previously described standardized bioinformatics pipeline. Transcriptome data sets from spaceflight-grown and corresponding clinostat-grown cells were compared by using three different methods: (i) principal component analysis, (ii) analysis of differentially expressed genes, and (iii) gene set enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways. All three analyses found a low degree of concordance between the spaceflight and corresponding clinostat transcriptome data sets, ranging from 0.9% to 5.3% concordance. These results are in agreement with prior studies that also revealed low concordances between spaceflight and clinostat transcriptomes of the Gram-negative bacteria Rhodospirillum rubrum and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results are discussed from the perspective of several potential confounding factors, and suggestions are offered with the aim of achieving increased concordance between clinostat and spaceflight data.",Morrison MD; Nicholson WL,Bacillus subtilis; Clinostat; HARV; RPM; Simulated microgravity; Spaceflight; Transcriptomics,2020,Astrobiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",
35999570,Machine learning algorithm to characterize antimicrobial resistance associated with the International Space Station surface microbiome.,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has a detrimental impact on human health on Earth and it is equally concerning in other environments such as space habitat due to microgravity, radiation and confinement, especially for long-distance space travel. The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking-1 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes). RESULTS: We have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii, a bacteria related to urinary tract infection in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT-1 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance genes from many isolates, including two top-ranking species that corresponded to strains of Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus. Computational predictions were experimentally validated by antibiotic resistance profiles in these two species, showing a high degree of concordance. Specifically, disc assay data confirmed the high resistance of these two pathogens to various beta-lactam antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans.

32933026,Integrated RNA-seq Analysis Indicates Asynchrony in Clock Genes between Tissues under Spaceflight.,"Rodent models have been widely used as analogs for estimating spaceflight-relevant molecular mechanisms in human tissues. NASA GeneLab provides access to numerous spaceflight omics datasets that can potentially generate novel insights and hypotheses about fundamental space biology when analyzed in new and integrated fashions. Here, we performed a pilot study to elucidate space biological mechanisms across tissues by reanalyzing mouse RNA-sequencing spaceflight data archived on NASA GeneLab. Our results showed that clock gene expressions in spaceflight mice were altered compared with those in ground control mice. Furthermore, the results suggested that spaceflight promotes asynchrony of clock gene expressions between peripheral tissues. Abnormal circadian rhythms are associated not only with jet lag and sleep disorders but also with cancer, lifestyle-related diseases, and mental disorders. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of elucidating the causes of circadian rhythm disruptions using the unique approach of space biology research to one day potentially develop countermeasures that benefit humans on Earth and in space.",Fujita SI; Rutter L; Ong Q; Muratani M,RNA-seq; bioinformatics; circadian rhythm; gene expression; genomics; microgravity; space biology; spaceflight,2020,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",Journal Article,15K21745/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/; 20H03234/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/
32375154,The NASA Twins Study: The Effect of One Year in Space on Long-Chain Fatty Acid Desaturases and Elongases.,"BACKGROUND: At present, there is no clear understanding of the effect of long-duration spaceflight on the major enzymes that govern the metabolism of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. To address this gap in knowledge, we used data from the NASA Twins Study, which includes a multiscale omics investigation of the changes that occurred during a year-long (340 days) human spaceflight. Embedded within the NASA Twins data are specific analytes associated with fatty acid metabolism. OBJECTIVES: To examine the long-chain fatty acid desaturases and elongases in a single human during 1 year in space. METHOD: One male twin was on board the International Space Station (ISS) for 1 year, while his monozygotic twin served as a genetically matched ground control. Longitudinal assessments included the genome, epige-nome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, microbiome, and immunome during the mission, as well as 6 months before and after. The gene-specific fatty acid desaturase and elongase transcriptome data (FADS1, FADS2, ELOVL2, and ELOVL5) were extracted from untargeted RNA-seq measurements derived from white blood cell fractions. RESULTS: Most data from the elongases and desaturases exhibited relatively similar expression profiles (R2 >0.6) over time for the CD8, CD19, and lymphocyte-depleted (LD) cell fractions, indicating overall conservation of function within and between the subjects. Both cell-type and temporal specificity was observed in some cases, and some differences were also apparent between the polyadenylated (polyA) fraction of processed RNAs versus the ribodepleted (ribo-) fraction. The flight subject showed a stronger enrichment of the fatty acid metabolic process pathway across almost all cell types (columns, CD4, CD8, CPT, and LD), most especially in the ribodepleted fraction of RNA, but also with the polyA+ fraction of RNA. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) measures across three related fatty acid metabolism pathways showed a differential between the ground and the flight subject. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be no persistent alteration of desaturase and elongase gene expression associated with 1 year in space. However, these data provide evidence that cellular lipid metabolism can be responsive and dynamic to spaceflight, even though it appears cell-type and context specific, most notably in terms of the fraction of RNA measured and the collection protocols. These results also provide new evidence of mid-flight spikes in expression of selected genes, which may indicate transient responses to specific insults during spaceflight.",Schmidt MA; Meydan C; Schmidt CM; Afshinnekoo E; Mason CE,Arachidonic acid; Desaturase; Docosahexaenoic acid; Eicosapentaenoic acid; Elongase; Fatty acids; International Space Station; Multiscale omics; NASA; NASA Twins Study; Spaceflight,2020,Lifestyle genomics,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Twin Study",R01 AI151059/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; P01 HD067244/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States; R01 AI125416/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; R01 ES021006/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States; R01 CA249054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; P01 CA214274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R01 MH117406/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States
31844325,Multi-omics analysis of multiple missions to space reveal a theme of lipid dysregulation in mouse liver.,"Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) & BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, these animals were sacrificed on-orbit and exposed to varying spaceflight durations (i.e. 21, 37, and 42 days vs 13 days for the Shuttle mice). Oil Red O (ORO) staining showed abnormal lipid accumulation in all space-flown mice compared to ground controls regardless of strain or exposure duration. Similarly, transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing revealed several pathways that were affected in both strains related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid and fatty acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be commonly regulated across all conditions including Glucagon (GCG) and Insulin (INS). Moreover, quantitative proteomic analysis showed that a number of lipid related proteins were changed in the livers during spaceflight. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of lipotoxic pathways are the result of space stressors alone and this activation occurs in various genetic backgrounds during spaceflight exposures of weeks to months. If similar responses occur in humans, a prolonged change of these pathways may result in the development of liver disease and should be investigated further.",Beheshti A; Chakravarty K; Fogle H; Fazelinia H; Silveira WAD; Boyko V; Polo SL; Saravia-Butler AM; Hardiman G; Taylor D; Galazka JM; Costes SV,,2019,Scientific reports,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",
33646011,Bacterial Cellulose Retains Robustness but Its Synthesis Declines After Exposure to a Mars-like Environment Simulated Outside the International Space Station.,"Cellulose is a widespread macromolecule in terrestrial environments and a major architectural component of microbial biofilm. Therefore, cellulose might be considered a biosignature that indicates the presence of microbial life. We present, for the first time, characteristics of bacterial cellulose after long-term spaceflight and exposure to simuled Mars-like stressors. The pristine cellulose-based pellicle membranes from a kombucha microbial community (KMC) were exposed outside the International Space Station, and after their return to Earth, the samples were reactivated and cultured for 2.5 years to discern whether the KMC could be restored. Analyses of cellulose polymer integrity and mechanical properties of cellulose-based pellicle films, as well as the cellulose biosynthesis-related genes' structure and expression, were performed. We observed that (i) the cellulose polymer integrity was not significantly changed under Mars-like conditions; (ii) de novo cellulose production was 1.5 times decreased in exposed KMC samples; (iii) the dry cellulose yield from the reisolated Komagataeibacter oboediens was 1.7 times lower than by wild type; (iv) there was no significant change in mechanical properties of the de novo synthesized cellulose-based pellicles produced by the exposed KMCs and K. oboediens; and (v) the gene, encoding biosynthesis of cellulose (bcsA) of the K. oboediens, was downregulated, and no topological change or mutation was observed in any of the bcs operon genes, indicating that the decreased cellulose production by the space-exposed samples was probably due to epigenetic regulation. Our results suggest that the cellulose-based pellicle could be a good material with which to protect microbial communities during space journeys, and the cellulose produced by KMC members could be suitable in the fabrication of consumer goods for extraterrestrial locations.",Orlovska I; Podolich O; Kukharenko O; Zaets I; Reva O; Khirunenko L; Zmejkoski D; Rogalsky S; Barh D; Tiwari S; Kumavath R; Góes-Neto A; Azevedo V; Brenig B; Ghosh P; de Vera JP; Kozyrovska N,Bacterial cellulose; Extraterrestrial stressors; Komagataeibacter oboediens; Kombucha multimicrobial community; Microbial biosignature; The bcs operon.,2021,Astrobiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",

Furthermore, Kombucha Mutualistic Community (KMC) has been recently proposed to be used during long space missions as both a living functional fermented product to improve astronauts' health and an efficient source of bacterial nanocellulose. In this study, we compared KMC structure and functions before and after samples were exposed to the space/Mars-like environment outside the International Space Station in order to investigate the changes related to their re-adaptation to Earth-like conditions by shotgun metagenomics, using both diversity and functional analyses of Community Ecology and Complex Networks approach. Our study revealed that the long-term exposure to space/Mars-like conditions on low Earth orbit may disorganize the KMC to such extent that it will not restore the initial community structure; however, KMC core microorganisms of the community were maintained. Nonetheless, there were no significant differences in the community functions, meaning that the KMC communities are ecologically resilient.

HZE exposure is a major risk factor for astronauts during deep-space travel due to the possibility of HZE-induced cancer. A systems biology integrated omics approach encompassing transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and functional biochemical assays was used to identify microenvironmental changes induced by HZE exposure.

25102863,An integrated omics analysis: impact of microgravity on host response to lipopolysaccharide in vitro.,"BACKGROUND: Microgravity facilitates the opportunistic infections by augmenting the pathogenic virulence and suppressing the host resistance. Hence the extraterrestrial infections may activate potentially novel bionetworks different from the terrestrial equivalent, which could only be probed by investigating the host-pathogen relationship with a minimum of terrestrial bias. RESULTS: We customized a cell culture module to expose human endothelial cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The assay was carried out onboard the STS-135 spaceflight, and a concurrent ground study constituted the baseline. Transcriptomic investigation revealed a possible immune blunting in microgravity suppressing in particular Lbp, MyD88 and MD-2, which encode proteins responsible for early LPS uptake. Certain cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8, surged in response to LPS insult in microgravity, as suggested by the proteomics study. Contrasting proteomic expressions of B2M, TIMP-1 and VEGRs suggested impaired pro-survival adaptation and healing mechanisms. Differential expression of miR-200a and miR-146b suggested the susceptibility of hosts in spaceflight to oxidative stress and further underscored the influence of microgravity on the immunity. CONCLUSIONS: A molecular interpretation explaining the etiology of the microgravitational impact on the host-pathogen relationship elucidated comprehensive immune blunting of the host cells responding to LPS challenges. Longer LPS exposure prompted a delayed host response, potentially ineffectual in preventing pathogens from opportunistic invasion. Significant consequences include the subsequent failure in recruiting the growth factors and a debilitated apoptosis. Follow up studies with larger sample size are warranted.",Chakraborty N; Gautam A; Muhie S; Miller SA; Jett M; Hammamieh R,,2014,BMC genomics,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",
30717456,GeneLab Database Analyses Suggest Long-Term Impact of Space Radiation on the Cardiovascular System by the Activation of FYN Through Reactive Oxygen Species.,"Space radiation has recently been considered a risk factor for astronauts' cardiac health. As an example, for the case of how to query and identify datasets within NASA's GeneLab database and demonstrate the database utility, we used an unbiased systems biology method for identifying key genes/drivers for the contribution of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. This knowledge can contribute to designing appropriate experiments targeting these specific pathways. Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/6 mice followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of 1 GeV proton or 150 mGy of 1 GeV/n (56)Fe were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the International Space Station (ISS). We observed common molecular pathways between simulated space radiation and HUVECs flown on the ISS. The analysis suggests FYN is the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be transient and would upregulate FYN, which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. The transcriptomic signature of exposure to protons was also much closer to the spaceflight signature than (56)Fe's signature. To our knowledge, this is the first time GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of omics analysis. More generally, this work also demonstrates how to combine animal radiation studies done on the ground and spaceflight studies to evaluate human risk in space.",Beheshti A; McDonald JT; Miller J; Grabham P; Costes SV,FYN; GeneLab; HUVECs; HZE irradiation; ROS; cardiomyocytes; cardiovascular; iron; protons; reactive oxygen species; space radiation,2019,International journal of molecular sciences,Journal Article,Solicitation #: NNH16ZTT001N-FG/NASA Space Biology program grant Appendix G:
28230966,Increasing Peak Capacity in Nontargeted Omics Applications by Combining Full Scan Field Asymmetric Waveform Ion Mobility Spectrometry with Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.,"Full scan field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) combined with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-FAIMS-MS) is shown to enhance peak capacity for omics applications. A miniaturized FAIMS device capable of rapid compensation field scanning has been incorporated into an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis, allowing the acquisition of full scan FAIMS and MS nested data sets within the time scale of a UHPLC peak. Proof of principle for the potential of scanning LC-FAIMS-MS in omics applications is demonstrated for the nontargeted profiling of human urine using a HILIC column. The high level of orthogonality between FAIMS and MS provides additional unique compound identifiers with detection of features based on retention time, FAIMS dispersion field and compensation field (DF and CF), and mass-to-charge (m/z). Extracted FAIMS full scan data can be matched to standards to aid the identification of unknown analytes. The peak capacity for features detected in human urine using LC-FAIMS-MS was increased approximately threefold compared to LC-MS alone due to a combination of the reduction of chemical noise and separation of coeluting isobaric species across the entire analytical space. The use of FAIMS-selected in source collision induced dissociation (FISCID) yields fragmentation of ions, which reduces sample complexity associated with overlapping fragmentation patterns and provides structural information on the selected precursor ions.",Arthur KL; Turner MA; Reynolds JC; Creaser CS,,2017,Analytical chemistry,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
32676055,Fitness of Outer Membrane Vesicles From Komagataeibacter intermedius Is Altered Under the Impact of Simulated Mars-like Stressors Outside the International Space Station.,"Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), produced by nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, have potentially useful biotechnological applications in extraterrestrial extreme environments. However, their biological effects under the impact of various stressors have to be elucidated for safety reasons. In the spaceflight experiment, model biofilm kombucha microbial community (KMC) samples, in which Komagataeibacter intermedius was a dominant community-member, were exposed under simulated Martian factors (i.e., pressure, atmosphere, and UV-illumination) outside the International Space Station (ISS) for 1.5 years. In this study, we have determined that OMVs from post-flight K. intermedius displayed changes in membrane composition, depending on the location of the samples and some other factors. Membrane lipids such as sterols, fatty acids (FAs), and phospholipids (PLs) were modulated under the Mars-like stressors, and saturated FAs, as well as both short-chain saturated and trans FAs, appeared in the membranes of OMVs shed by both post-UV-illuminated and ""dark"" bacteria. The relative content of zwitterionic and anionic PLs changed, producing a change in surface properties of outer membranes, thereby resulting in a loss of interaction capability with polynucleotides. The changed composition of membranes promoted a bigger OMV size, which correlated with changes of OMV fitness. Biochemical characterization of the membrane-associated enzymes revealed an increase in their activity (DNAse, dehydrogenase) compared to wild type. Other functional membrane-associated capabilities of OMVs (e.g., proton accumulation, interaction with linear DNA, or synaptosomes) were also altered after exposure to the spaceflight stressors. Despite alterations in membranes, vesicles did not acquire endotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and neurotoxicity. Altogether, our results show that OMVs, originating from rationally selected nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, can be considered as candidates in the design of postbiotics or edible mucosal vaccines for in situ production in extreme environment. Furthermore, these OMVs could also be used as promising delivery vectors for applications in Astromedicine.

24373636,A multi-omic analysis of an Enterococcus faecium mutant reveals specific genetic mutations and dramatic changes in mRNA and protein expression.,"BACKGROUND: For a long time, Enterococcus faecium was considered a harmless commensal of the mammalian gastrointestinal (GI) tract and was used as a probiotic in fermented foods. In recent decades, E. faecium has been recognised as an opportunistic pathogen that causes diseases such as neonatal meningitis, urinary tract infections, bacteremia, bacterial endocarditis and diverticulitis. E. faecium could be taken into space with astronauts and exposed to the space environment. Thus, it is necessary to observe the phenotypic and molecular changes of E. faecium after spaceflight. RESULTS: An E. faecium mutant with biochemical features that are different from those of the wild-type strain was obtained from subculture after flight on the SHENZHOU-8 spacecraft. To understand the underlying mechanism causing these changes, the whole genomes of both the mutant and the WT strains were sequenced using Illumina technology. The genomic comparison revealed that dprA, a recombination-mediator gene, and arpU, a gene associated with cell wall growth, were mutated. Comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses showed that differentially expressed genes or proteins were involved with replication, recombination, repair, cell wall biogenesis, glycometabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, predicted general function and energy production/conversion. CONCLUSION: This study analysed the comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic changes of an E. faecium mutant from subcultures that were loaded on the SHENZHOU-8 spacecraft. The implications of these gene mutations and expression changes and their underlying mechanisms should be investigated in the future. We hope that the current exploration of multiple ""-omics"" analyses of this E. faecium mutant will provide clues for future studies on this opportunistic pathogen.",Chang D; Zhu Y; An L; Liu J; Su L; Guo Y; Chen Z; Wang Y; Wang L; Wang J; Li T; Fang X; Fang C; Yang R; Liu C,,2013,BMC microbiology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
