#### Single-word search <a href="#f4y457hcuqrc" id="f4y457hcuqrc"></a>

**Below are some examples of searches.**

* **Single-term search:** These are quick and easy and usually create long lists of loosely connected studies.
  * **Single-term example:** Search results from searching the single term ‘genome’

#### Multi-word search <a href="#u3geep5fcd5d" id="u3geep5fcd5d"></a>

**Choosing two or more keywords can quickly identify studies related to your area of interest.**

* Search results will contain all the search terms and in this example, filter down to 14 OSDR accessions.
  * **Duel-word example:** Search results from searching on multiple terms ‘genome ecotype’

#### Multiple-field searches <a href="#yo5jgk217hqz" id="yo5jgk217hqz"></a>

**How to create efficient searches by searching multiple fields.**

**Multiple-term search:** Search in multiple files such as general search filters, study search filters and keywords or phrases can be used to create concise lists of related studies.

* **Multiple-term search example:** Search results from multiple-term search combined with an additional selection of “Spaceflight” specific “Project type” are shown below.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Slide15.png" alt="The NASA logo, website navigation menu, and page title are displayed in the header section. The left-hand side of the webpage contains the filters mentioned previously. In the center of the page the “Search Datasets” box has been highlighted, and the term “genome ecotype” has been entered. In addition, the “Space flight” has been selected as a factor and is highlighted with a red box. This search identifies 4 studies that use these terms in their metadata."><figcaption><p><em>The left-hand side of the webpage contains the filters mentioned previously.

### Boolean Operator Options <a href="#l33m3u35t1a7" id="l33m3u35t1a7"></a>

**How to make your search more insightful or precise using defined boolean operators.**

Please note that you may not use both the Boolean operators and double quotations together.

The resulting set is the same as searching for the terms ‘genome’ and ‘ecotype without the operator.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="190"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Operator</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>AND</td><td>ALL search terms must be present (default Boolean search)</td></tr><tr><td>OR</td><td>ANY of your search terms can be present</td></tr><tr><td>NOT</td><td>Exclude words from your search</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Double Quotation marks define search phrases as essential for a precise match requirement.**

* If multiple words are in double quotations, then those words must match exactly in the order given, as shown below:
  * **Quotation example:** Search results from searching the exact term “genome ecotype” by using quotation marks. In this example, no search results were due to a combination of keywords and Boolean operators that failed to match any sample in the database.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Slide14%20(1).png" alt="The NASA logo, website navigation menu, and page title are displayed in the header section. The left-hand side of the webpage contains the filters mentioned previously. In the center of the page the “Search Datasets” box has been highlighted, and the term “genome ecotype” has been entered, this time in quotation marks. This search resulted in no matches being found."><figcaption><p><em>The left-hand side of the webpage contains the "genotype ecotype" search results. In the center of the page the “Search Datasets” box has been highlighted, and the term “genome ecotype” has been entered, this time in quotation marks. This search resulted in no matches being found.</em></p></figcaption></figure>

#### Boolean NOT operator. <a href="#w4aeta4y960m" id="w4aeta4y960m"></a>

**Refining search techniques to identify related studies.**

* Exclude studies containing the term(s) from your search using the minus prefix (-). This is the same as using the NOT operator which is the same as using the NOT operator.
  * **Not operator example:** Below is a search using the ‘NOT’ operator. genome ecotype –genotype.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Slide16%20(1).png" alt="The NASA logo, website navigation menu, and page title are displayed in the header section. The left-hand side of the webpage contains the filters mentioned previously. In the center of the page the “Search Datasets” box has been highlighted, and the terms “genome ecotype - genotypes” are highlighted to show how Not operators can be used to adjust the search results."><figcaption><p><em>The left-hand side of the webpage contains the "genoe ecotype - genotypes" search results. In the center of the page the “Search Datasets” box has been highlighted, and the terms “genome ecotype - genotypes” are highlighted to show how Not operators can be used to adjust the search results.</em></p></figcaption></figure>

#### Boolean AND operator. <a href="#c7u6se40fjeh" id="c7u6se40fjeh"></a>

**How to use AND operators to make your search more precise.**

* Require term(s) in your search using the plus prefix (+). This is the same as using the AND operator.
  * **An operator example:** genome sequencing +WS ecotype

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Slide17%20(1).png" alt="The left-hand side of the webpage contains the filters mentioned previously. In the center of the page the “Search Datasets” box has been highlighted, and the terms “genome ecotype + WS ecotype” are highlighted to show how AND operators can be used to adjust the search results."><figcaption><p><em>The left-hand side of the webpage contains the filters mentioned previously. In the center of the page the “Search Datasets” box has been highlighted, and the terms “genome ecotype + WS ecotype” are highlighted to show how AND operators can be used to adjust the search results.</em></p></figcaption></figure>

#### Boolean \* wild card operator. <a href="#v28y5ignyqya" id="v28y5ignyqya"></a>

**How to use a \* wild card to find closely related studies.**

* Search on unspecified portions of the search terms using an asterisk (\*)
  * **A \*wild card Boolean operator example:** genome ecotype \* Gravity. In this example, we identified 2 studies with samples that received variable quantities of gravity as a study factor.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Slide18%20(1).png" alt="The NASA logo, website navigation menu, and page title are displayed in the header section. The left-hand side of the webpage contains the filters mentioned previously. In the center of the page the “Search Datasets” box has been highlighted, and the terms “genome ecotype + * Gravity” is highlighted to show how unspecified “wild card” operators can be used to adjust the search result."><figcaption><p><em>The left-hand side of the webpage contains filters with a Booealn wild card operator being used to define the gravity level.

### Federating data sources <a href="#id-86tmuz33uzle" id="id-86tmuz33uzle"></a>

**How to add an external database to your search.**

OSDA has integrated, commonly termed a data federation, with multiple heterogeneous external databases. Users can search across multiple databases in addition to OSDA. The links in the federated search results are to the authoritative external databases.

OSDA is currently federated with:

* [The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
* [The European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) Proteomics Identification (PRIDE)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/)
* [The Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) Metagenomics Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (MG-RAST)](http://metagenomics.anl.gov/)

The OSDA repository does not contain copies of the data sets found in the external databases, GeneLab maintains metadata records (e.g., information about the data) of the external data sets in federated databases. These records are automatically updated to keep the GeneLab database search content up to date with the external databases.

To search in one or all of these databases, enter text search term(s) and select the desired databases as shown below. Federated search results are then shown. You may change the database selection(s) at any time and the search results will be updated accordingly.

* In addition to searching the GeneLab Data Repository, federated data repositories can be included in the search.
  * **Example:** Below are examples of federated data repositories that can be searched.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Slide19.png" alt="The chart shows the user which of the specific databases have been selected to be included in the general search filters. If the user does not have a specific database in mind GeneLab and ALSDA are automatically selected, these options can be left on or turned off or they can also add NIH GEO, EBI PRIDE and AML MG-RAST to search." width="563"><figcaption><p><em>The user can select specific databases to be included in the general search filters. If the user does not have a specific database in mind GeneLab and ALSDA are automatically selected, these options can be left on or turned off or they can also add NIH GEO, EBI PRIDE and AML MG-RAST to search.</em></p></figcaption></figure>

### Study Search Filters <a href="#id-5dnlxovdz6up" id="id-5dnlxovdz6up"></a>

**The filter box on the left can filter through the OSDR to find studies related to your expertise or interests.**

In addition, OSDR offers filters that facilitate the search process for related studies within the GeneLab repository. These filters encompass Project Type, Factors, Organisms, and Assay Types. The menu associated with each category contains pre-populated terms derived from datasets included in the OSDR repository. It is noteworthy that the use of these filters is possible without the inclusion of any additional search terms.

* After filter selection, the filter is immediately applied, potentially altering the number of search results displayed. Filter values are shown as text above the results as they are added. Multiple options from the same filter allow users to select more closely related studies.
* For instance, to filter your search, choose 'Spaceflight' from the 'Factors' menu, followed by 'RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)' and 'Seedlings' from the 'Tissue' menu. OSDR will search for studies that have either of these terms as factors.
* Users can change the filter terms they have selected by selecting the filter again from the drop-down menu or by clicking the "Clear" button. It is important to note that the "Clear" button only eliminates the filter conditions and does not erase any text search terms entered before the filters. In addition to keyword searches in the OSDA, users can also search using key factors from the metadata of the studies.
  * **Example:** Below is an example set of filters that can be used to identify studies with similar experimental designs.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Slide20.png" alt="The Image shows a series of Filters grouped by Assay type, Organism, Tissue and Factor. Spaceflight, RNAseq, Plant and Seedling were selected."><figcaption><p><em>The Image shows a series of Filters grouped by Assay type, Organism, Tissue and Factor.

### Principal component analysis <a href="#we9brgzii034" id="we9brgzii034"></a>

**Principal component analysis (PCA) shows clusters of samples based on their similarity.**

* **PCA:** Click on samples to the right to select the desired samples to be viewed on the PCA plot. Icons on the upper right region of the plot allow for downloading, navigating and saving the plot. You can choose either 2D or 3D plots. If you click on the 3D graph and hold the left mouse button you can rotate the graph in 3D to optimise the angle and potentially highlight specific clustering patterns.
  * **Single study PCA example:** 3D plot has been selected and PC1, PC2, and PC3 are presented on the graph. Drop-down options allow users to replace these PC’s by selecting an alternative from the menu.
  * We can also see next to the “Color by factor” label that the current “all” is selected and the yellow arrow shows how the names of the factors have been combined in the figure legend.
  * It can be important to explore the PC's that separate the data based on different factors as the main factor such as spaceflight might not always be captured by the first or second PC's values. Sometimes results presented as a series of 2D PCA plots can be clearer than a 3D plot present 3 PC values.

### Pair plots <a href="#eewgwyi97mqc" id="eewgwyi97mqc"></a>

**The “Pair plots” can be used to compare 2 samples from group 1 or group 2 respectively.**

* Drop-down menus allow the researcher to select different replicates and view the comparative gene expression dispersion plots. This is useful for finding outlining samples or loci and the difference between each sample can be refined by adjusting the color threshold (default 20). In the top right-hand corner, there is a menu of graph-specific options, including snapshot, zoom, lasso, and full screen. The “update” button is highlighted in blue and needs to be pressed if you change any of the factors.
  * **Pair plot replicate comparison example:** We can see the % difference threshold is set to 20, we can also see the names of the samples being paired against one another and they are replicated of the same treatment.

### Volcano Plots <a href="#id-3cb9r7if7di1" id="id-3cb9r7if7di1"></a>

**Volcano plots show statistical significance vs magnitude of change.**

* To present the Volcano plot, the p-value is converted using a -log10 transformation to enhance the visibility of significant loci. The Fold Change (FC) is transformed using a Log2 transformation to balance the representation of upregulated and downregulated genes. This facilitates the identification of genes with significant statistical differences and substantial expression changes. Users can select parameters, samples for comparison, and the maximum adjusted p-value using the drop-down menu. The Log2 FC threshold can be adjusted using the menu bar at the top. The image can be exported or explored using the Zoom or Lasso tool to investigate specific clusters or outliers.
  * **Volcano plot example:** This graph generated by OSD-37 shows the adjusted P-value on the y-axis after it has experienced a -log10 transformation compared to the Log10 fold change (FC). In this example, _SCPL50_ appears to have a dramatic suppression during flight.

### Table of gene expression data <a href="#t7933tpb5wrd" id="t7933tpb5wrd"></a>

**A summary table of data compiling gene RefSeq IDs, Symbols, Log2Fc, P values, and Adjusted-P-values is often the most concise way to view data.**

* In the top right-hand corner, boxes allow the user to filter the table based on the maximum P-VAL (P-value), maximum ADJP (adjusted P-value), LOG2FC (Log2 transformed fold change) or to just search for gene REFSEQ ID or gene Symbol (Name). In the top left of the table, the buttons allow the user to copy, export to CVS, Excel, PDF or even directly Print.
  * **Summary of results example:** This table shows the top 10 most significantly differentially expressed loci from OSD-37. The maxim adjusted p-value is set to 0.05, in the bottom left it shows 2445 entries selected by this threshold, in the bottom right it shows that there are 245 pages of data (as the screen had been adjusted to show 10 loci per page). These can be downloaded for further analysis.

### Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) <a href="#l6v0c891a6ps" id="l6v0c891a6ps"></a>

**GSEA is a tool that enables statistical comparisons of genetic and molecular databases.**

[“Geneset Enrichment Analysis](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp) (GSEA) - For a detailed explanation of GSEA statistics (ES, NES, FDR, P-value) see the [\*GSEA Statistics](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideTEXT.htm#\_Enrichment\_Score\_\(ES\)) website. GSEA is performed using GSEApy 0.10.3, for more information about the parameters used and how to run GSEApy GSEA function: [GSEA](https://gseapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run.html) or [GSEApy documentation](https://gseapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html). All gmt files were downloaded from Enrichr: [Enrichr libraries](https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/#libraries). The number of “genesets” and maximum false discovery rate (FDR) are set to their default values 6 and 0.25 respectively. The Permutations, type, min size and max size are all left as default.

* The are many plot types that be used to view these results including, Enrichment Score Plot, NES Plot, Dot Plot, Ridge Ploy and Network Plot.
  * **Example GSEA:** Before starting the analysis select the plot type you wish to use. This example uses a NES Plot (bar plot) but there are often logical reasons to present different types of data in different types of plot(s) to help disguise between results.

**Selecting different databases for statistical analysis can identify different responses and provide alternative perspectives and insights from the results.**

* Numerous ontology databases and statistical methodologies are available for application to the processed DESeq2 results.
  * **Ontology database example description:** A menu of pop-up menu databases can be opened and one selected based on your model organism and question of choice. 5 different statical methods can be used by GSEA, signal to noise, T test, Fold change, Difference of class and Log2 Fold change.

### Dot plots <a href="#bj3385d7e61m" id="bj3385d7e61m"></a>

**Dot plots can present 3 types of data on the same graph.**

The OSDR facilitates the visualization of the normalized enrichment score, false discovery rate, and Gene ratio values of all differentially expressed pathways on a single graph for user evaluation.

* **Phenotype Permutation vs. Gene Set Permutation:** Choosing the appropriate permutation method can influence your results. Phenotype permutation is generally preferred as it maintains the biological context of your experiment.
  * **Example dot plot:** demonstrating the analysis of the OSD-37 KEGG\_2019 pathway employing the Fold change method and “Phenotype” permutation type. The Minimum and maximum size parameters were retained at their default values of 15 and 500 loci, respectively, as per standard practice. The quantities of “geneset”s” and the maximum false discovery rate (FDR) are set to their default values of 6 and 0.25, respectively.

### Ridge plots <a href="#zc2ql3hfusf9" id="zc2ql3hfusf9"></a>

**A ridge plot combines a density plot and a histogram to show how data, like Fold Change (FC), is distributed.**

The OSDR facilitates the visualization of the false discovery rate (FDR), and Foldchange values of all differentially expressed pathways on a single graph for user evaluation. This visualization aids in determining whether genes are predominantly upregulated, downregulated, or exhibit minimal change. The smooth, ridge-like form reveals trends, and the plot is compatible with log-transformed data, a common feature in fold-change analysis. Overlaying plots for various groups allows researchers to compare fold-change distributions.

* Ridge plots are effective tools for present GSEA analysis.
  * **Example Ridge plot:** This example ridge-plot was made with a “Fold Change” of loci from the KEGG\_2019 GSEA analysis data from OSD-37. The Minimum size and maximum size values were left to the default 15 and 500 loci as standard. The number of ““geneset”s” and maximum false discovery rate (FDR) are set to their default values 6 and 0.25 respectively.

### Network Plot <a href="#v5vfnpxc0gtj" id="v5vfnpxc0gtj"></a>

**A network plot uses dots that represent nodes of data points that describe the response detected in the analysis.**

* Network plots are effective tools for showing the variation in the number of genes involved in a detected response.
  * **Example network diagram:** it can be observed that the Ribosome possesses a greater number of loci that were implicated in that response ontology group. Even though "RNA degradation" and "Cell cycle" demonstrate a lesser quantity of associated genes, it is evident that they possess heightened significance due to their diminished adjusted P-value, as delineated by the gradient ranging from blue to red.

### Network Plot used in conjunction with pathway illustration

**A network plot uses dots that represent nodes of data points that describe the response detected in the analysis.**

* Network plots can be merged with pathway diagrams to help illustrate connections between enriched terms and concepts like cellular function. Figures can then be shared with other OSDR AWG collaborators on platforms like GitHub as staging for eventual publication in Zenodo and peer-reviewed journals.

### NES plots <a href="#j5wz6ra5953b" id="j5wz6ra5953b"></a>

**NES (Normalized Enrichment Score) plot offers a visual representation of the normalized enrichment score for gene sets identified by the user based on their parameters.**

* NES plots are an effect tool for viewing pathways that are identified by GSEA.
  * **Example NES plot:** The data from OSD-37 provides the normalized enrichment score adjacent to terms that possess enrichment in the selected database. KEGG\_2019 was used as the “geneset” for enrichment analysis. However, in this instance, we show it is possible to change the database analyzed. The bar plot then displays GO terms identified during the analysis when the GO\_cellular\_Componet\_AutoRIF gene set database was queried.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Slide45%20(1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><em>This image shows a NES plot and the options used to generate it. Situated at the top of the webpage is a search bar that facilitates the exploration of specific terms within the datasets and other “geneset" for analysis. Immediately beneath the search mechanism is a tabular structure providing alternative plot types and graph parameters. The bar plot structure summarizes distinct gene groups that are known to function in a similar location based on the GO-Cellular_Component_AutoRIF enrichment analysis. The Red dotted lines highlight the “number of “geneset”s” and the method values have been adjusted from their default values.</em></p></figcaption></figure>

### Enhancing NES plots

**Adjusting the parameters to influence the quantity and sequence of pathways detected.**

* NES plots have a numerical constant that can be adjusted to modify the appearance pathways that are identified by GSEA
  * **Numerical method example:** In this OSD-37 example we’ve changed the “Method” value to 0 (classic), which changes the normalized enrichment score and graph layout.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Slide46.png" alt="This image shows a screenshot from the OSDR Visualization software showing an NES plot graph and the options used to generate it. The bar plot structure summarizes distinct gene groups that are known to function in a similar location based on the GO-Cellular_Component_AutoRF enrichment analysis.

**Refining NES plots using the Method Value**

**Adjusting the “geneset” is highly recommended in the Method tab and can change the number and order of pathways identified.**

* When utilizing a normalized enrichment score plot (NES plot) to depict pathway enrichment via the fold change method, the graphical representation not only illustrates pathways with statistical significance but incorporates pathways that lack such significance.
  * **Number of “genesets” example:** In this example, the “Method” value is set to 1, and we’ve changed the “geneset” to Cellular\_Component\_AutoRIF\_Predicted\_zscore. Notice that the number of “genesets” is now set to 15 and that the color coding shows that only 4 of these are significant based on the current threshold of a maximum False Discovery Rate of 0.25.

### Fine-tuning permutations

**Adjusting the permutation value can be used to improve the GSEA statistical model.**

GSEA calculates enrichment scores by comparing the data to a random null distribution. This null distribution is generated by permuting the phenotype labels of your samples numerous times. A higher number of permutations leads to a more precise estimation of the p-value associated with your enrichment score.

* You can choose the number of permutations to run, with a higher number leading to potentially more accurate p-values.
  * **Example Finetuning Permutations:** Altering the default premonition from 300 to 500 in the example description resulted in a significant change in the FDR of the "cytoskeleton" Gene Ontology term.
